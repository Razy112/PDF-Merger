# PDF-Merger
I created a PDF Merger ready to be used by anyone. Inside the build folder there is an .exe that runs the program without the need of an IDE.
Quick tutorial:

1 Select any PDF files you want to merge into one

2 You have the choice to merge them or change the order in any way you want using the "Move up", "Move down" buttons.

3 Selecting new pdfs will reset the entire selections as shown below so if you want to add files use the "Add PDF Files" or "Delete Selected PDF" 
if you want to remove a file
